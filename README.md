# Ascension

Ascension is a name I give to my place for documenting my learning journey.

I chose this name for 2 reasons.
1. I wanted to make it sound cool
2. Learning is an uphill climb (Ascension)

In the docs directory is where I start with GFM so any one of the docs can render correctly here on Github.

Then I pull the document into the Writerside project where I can add semantic markup and styling that will render
nicer looking documents in HTML form with a nice table of contents. 

The pretty docs are located at [Ascension](https://isimmons.github.io/ascension/home.html)
