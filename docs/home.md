I have been a student of programming and development for quite some time but never quite complete a project or stick to
one subject. In fact, I don't know if I could stick to one subject for too long without experiencing burn out and a
temptation to give up. There are so many things I want to learn and in the world of programming it seems that for every
thing you try to learn, once you get into it, you realize there are multiple other things you need to learn in order to
be successful at the first thing you were trying to learn.

For example, take "creating a simple web page". I had to learn HTML of course, then CSS, then Javascript. Then if I
wanted to be efficient I needed to learn how to use a good IDE. If I wanted data access I needed to learn a backend
language
like PHP. And I needed to learn SQL/MySQL. Along the way I'm learned some CLI (a little batch and a little bash).
I learned how to use cygwin for Linux tools on Windows. I learned how to install and use Linux.

To make a long story short, it started with the "simple HTML web page", one thing led to another, and now I can't keep
up with the huge number of technologies, languages, editors, IDEs, scripting, testing, automation, parsing, and linting
tools, concepts, standards, and best practices I have touched on.

I'm a jack of all trades, master of none, and not really great at any of them. And I'm OK with that for now. Luckily I
have a full time job (robot programming and maintenance) that allows me to spend my free time learning.

I really should consider spending more time mastering something, so I can make a career change at some point. But for
now the goal is to get more focused during study time and even if I continue to jump around, I think documenting things
will help me retain knowledge better and determine better what things I want to focus on.

Learning is a struggle - an uphill climb.

This is where I document my uphill climb.

I'm not quite ready to commit to the 100DaysOfCode thing, but I'm getting things ready for it. I've actually been
putting in way more hours every day than what the challenge calls for, but it has been very unfocused.

Inspired by [Mandy Hartman @hartmandyyy](https://x.com/hartmandyyy/) and the way she does the challenge, I want to
expand on the idea. I want to document the things I learn because writing it down helps seal the knowledge. It
also gives me notes I can refer back to. I will be forced to think more about my notes because they will be public
and I want them to make sense. Hopefully documenting my learning journey will help me stay focused.

I want to eventually expand the 100 days challenge into other areas of interest, but I'll start with coding.

The first bit of prep work I had to do is figuring out how to document. I'm trying something new.
