## Two Main Rules

1. Code a minimum of one hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet my progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

## My Method

Here's the plan besides satisfying the rules above.

1. Pick a coding topic
2. Get in that hour of coding
3. Extra study on the topic
4. Write about it (what I learned, what I struggled with)
5. Needs follow up? If so, follow up soon
6. Prepare code snippets, images if any and share in tweet with link/s to writing
